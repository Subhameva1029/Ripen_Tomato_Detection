RIPEN_TOMATO_DETECTION  is a simple python program to detect the red colored tomato ranging between [0, 50, 180] and [10, 255,255] BGR color.
It uses the template "_trial_model.jpeg" to match with the input image using "TM_SQDIFF" method.
Other images provided are used for testing phase_one and all the images except "real_1", "real_2", "trial_4", and "trial_6" are up to the mark.
better performance will be done in the future updates.
